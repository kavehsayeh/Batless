# Batless
A Monte Carlo implementation of Jon Bois's video "What if Barry Bonds had played without a baseball bat?" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMfT2cZGHg).
The premise is that during his legendary 2004 season, Barry Bonds's slugging power reached levels where pitches were terrified to give him a ball he could hit. In theory, he probably could've still managed a pretty decent number of walks even if he couldn't swing his bat. Bois explains it better than I could:
"Fear was his bat. He didn't need a bat. Let's take his bat away."
In his video, Bois, using data from Retrosheet (a website containing pitch-by-pitch data for thousands of baseball games), simulates essentially by hand how Bonds would have done in this situation. Preposterously, Bois calculate's Bonds's batless on-base percentage to be only .001 lower than his real life OBP in 2004 - 0.609. However, this is a result of only one simulation - it's possible Bonds is just lucky. So I wrote this program to run Bois's procedure a couple hundred times and see if that's just a lucky fluke. As it turns out, the average of these simulations is just north of .590 - not quite Bois's figure, but still good for the best single-season OBP of all time, right after Bonds's real 2004 season, of course.
